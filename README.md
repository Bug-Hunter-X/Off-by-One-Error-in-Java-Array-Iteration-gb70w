This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `BuggyArray.java` file shows the erroneous code, while `FixedArray.java` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from using `<=` in the loop condition, causing an attempt to access an index beyond the array's bounds. The corrected version uses `<` to iterate correctly within the bounds of the array.
